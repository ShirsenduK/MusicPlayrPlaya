Mac OS X Client for MusicPlayr.com

A simple Mac App which sits on your taskbar and plays music for you. Control your music using media keys of your Mac.

This is my first dig at a Mac App so be ready for bugs. :-D. Please feel free to file them, I will try and fix them.

Known issue:
Facebook login doesn't work as opening a new window for OAuth is a strict no-no for me. Hopefully, the guys at musicplayr.com will add Facebook autologin soon and this bug should be resolved automagically.


Special thanks to <a href="http://www.musicplayr.com">MusicPlayr.com</a> for creating an awesome music discovery platform, <a href="https://github.com/guidefreitas">Guilherme Defreitas</a> for letting me use his code as a starting point for my app, <a href="https://github.com/nevyn">Joachim Bengtsson</a> for hacking media keys for Mac OS X and most importantly everyone from Sadhu Dham. :)
