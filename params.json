Control your music using media keys of your Mac.\r\n\r\nThis is my first dig at a Mac App so be ready for bugs. :-D. Please feel free to file them, I will try and fix them.\r\n\r\n**Known issue:**\r\nFacebook login doesn't work as opening a new window for OAuth is a strict no-no for me. Hopefully, the guys at musicplayr.com will add Facebook autologin soon and this bug should be resolved automagically.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Special thanks to <a href=\"http://www.musicplayr.com\">MusicPlayr.com</a> for creating an awesome music discovery platform, <a href=\"https://github.com/guidefreitas\">Guilherme Defreitas</a> for letting me use his code as a starting point for my app, <a href=\"https://github.com/nevyn\">Joachim Bengtsson</a> for hacking media keys for Mac OS X and most importantly everyone from 205. :)**\r\n\r\nShirsendu \"Tr0y\" Karmakar.","note":"Don't delete this file!
